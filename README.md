# NBA regular season dashboard (per game data)

This repo contains a really simple dashboard, which is my first dashboard btw.

It shows some 22-23 NBA regular season data about the teams that are in the Conference Finals: Los Angeles Lakers, Boston Celtics, Denver Nuggets and Miami Heat.

This dashboard can be accessed by clicking it and then click "View raw". It contains the source links.
